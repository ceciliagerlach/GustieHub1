# **GustieHub - Student Communication App for Gustavus**

**GustieHub** is a user-friendly, mobile application for group-focused communication among students. The app was developed in response to the lack of an
official platform for Gustavus students to connect with peers and engage in community activities, which often led to inefficient communication across multiple apps.
By consolidating communication into one easy-to-use app, GustieHub simplifies how students stay connected.
